# Rewards-Allocation-Evaluation
The project is aimed at evaluating how effectively the rewards are driving user engagement and satisfaction in a company
The company needed insights to help optimise
reward offerings, identify key user segments, and understand the overall impact of the
reward types on user behaviour. Accurate data analysis is crucial for making data-driven
decisions on reward offerings and tailoring them to different user segments.


The project steps entailed :
1.Data cleaning & Reward points AAllocataion
Based on the analysis of the mentorship data and application of the point allocation rules, the results show a distribution of points awarded across different mentors. Mentors who met the criteria for signing up received their one-time 250 points. Mentors who conducted mentorship sessions with two different mentees earned an additional 1000 points. For mentorship relationships, points were allocated based on the number of sessions held with each mentee. Mentors who held two sessions with the same mentee, with each session meeting the 30-minute requirement and including job information, earned the maximum of 500 points per relationship.

However, mentors who only held one session or whose sessions did not meet the job information requirement received fewer points. This system ensures that points are distributed fairly based on mentor engagement and adherence to program guidelines. The accuracy of the point distribution was verified by creating test cases and comparing expected outcomes with actual point allocations in the system.

The testing process demonstrated that mentors who met the conditions of the program received points as per the rules, while those who didnâ€™t meet all the criteria were awarded partial points. Therefore, the system is functioning as expected, correctly reflecting the mentors' contributions.
